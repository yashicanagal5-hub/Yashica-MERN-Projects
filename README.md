# Yashica Excel Analytics Platform

A full-stack web application built with the MERN stack that transforms Excel data into interactive visualizations. This project was created as part of my skill development journey and turned out to be quite an interesting challenge!

## 🎯 What This Does

Essentially, this platform lets users upload Excel files (.xlsx/.xls) and automatically generates interactive charts and graphs from the data. Think of it as a way to make boring spreadsheet data actually visually interesting and useful for presentations.

## ✨ Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Excel File Upload**: Drag and drop interface for .xlsx and .xls files
- **Data Processing**: Automatically parses Excel data and identifies data types
- **Interactive Charts**: Various 2D and 3D visualizations (Line, Bar, Pie, Scatter, Area, Bubble charts)
- **Real-time Analytics**: Basic statistical calculations like mean, median, standard deviation
- **User Dashboard**: Personal workspace to manage uploaded files and analyses
- **Role-based Access**: Standard user vs admin permissions

### The Fancy Stuff
- **Chart Customization**: Change themes, colors, animations, and export options
- **Data Export**: Download charts as PNG, PDF, or SVG formats
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile devices with dark/light mode toggle
- **File Management**: Keeps track of upload history and file metadata
- **Admin Panel**: Basic admin interface for user management and system overview

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (What I Used)

### Backend Technologies
- **Node.js** - The runtime environment
- **Express.js** - Web framework (pretty standard choice)
- **MongoDB** - Database (decided to go with Mongoose ODM)
- **JWT** - For authentication (secure but straightforward)
- **Multer** - Handles file uploads
- **XLSX** - Parses Excel files
- **Chart.js** - Generates the charts

### Frontend Stack
- **React.js** - User interface library
- **Material-UI** - Component library (makes things look professional)
- **React Router** - Handles navigation between pages
- **Axios** - HTTP client for API calls
- **Chart.js & React-Chartjs-2** - Data visualization libraries
- **Three.js** - For those 3D visualizations
- **Framer Motion** - Adds smooth animations (users seem to like this)
- **React Query** - Handles data fetching and caching

### Development Tools
- **Nodemon** - Automatically restarts the server during development
- **ESLint** - Keeps code clean and consistent
- **Prettier** - Code formatting (helps with team collaboration)
- **Jest** - Testing framework

## 🚀 Getting Started

LOG_LEVEL=debug
```


## 🔒 Security Implementation

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Role-based Authorization**: Admin and user role separation
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **File Security**: Type and size validation for uploads
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing
- **Security Headers**: Helmet.js for Express security
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing for password storage

## 🧪 Testing Approach

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode for development
npm run test:watch

# Generate test coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test types
npm run test:unit          # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration   # Integration tests only
npm run test:e2e          # End-to-end tests only
```


### File Upload Troubleshooting
- **Issue**: Large files fail to upload
- **Solution**: Check `MAX_FILE_SIZE` in .env file (default: 50MB)
- **Issue**: File type not supported
- **Solution**: Ensure file is .xlsx or .xls format
- **Issue**: Upload directory not writable
- **Solution**: Check permissions on uploads/ directory

### Frontend Build Issues
```bash
# Clear npm cache and reinstall dependencies
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
rm -rf client/node_modules client/package-lock.json
npm install
cd client && npm install && cd ..
```

### CORS Configuration Issues
- **Symptom**: API calls fail with CORS errors
- **Solution**: Verify `CLIENT_URL` in .env matches your frontend URL
- **Solution**: Check CORS configuration in server.js

**About the Author**

Hi, I'm Yashica Nagal! This Excel Analytics Platform was developed as part of a full-stack development challenge provided by Zidio Development. The assignment(Internship Project) focused on creating a comprehensive web application that demonstrates proficiency in modern web technologies and data visualization techniques.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with the MERN stack, Excel file processing, interactive charting libraries, and user authentication systems. The challenge required implementing everything from basic file uploads to complex 3D data visualizations, which pushed me to explore new technologies and solve real-world problems in data analysis.

**Project Scope & Learning Objectives:**
- Master Excel file processing in a web environment
- Implement robust data visualization capabilities
- Build secure user authentication and role-based access
- Create responsive, modern user interfaces
- Develop full-stack applications with proper API design

When I'm not working on development challenges like this, I'm actively exploring emerging web technologies and contributing to open-source projects. This challenge from Zidio Development was instrumental in strengthening my full-stack development skills and understanding of modern data visualization approaches.

Feel free to connect and discuss the implementation details or share insights about similar challenges!
